# Profit Success Prediction in IMDB Dataset

## Introduction
This notebook is intended to serve two purposes:
  * To generally explore the initial dataset
  * To discover any correlations between the dataset features and the success of a movie
  
The scope of this project includes movies only made in the United States and I have defined a movie to be a "success" if it made any profit regardless of amount.

Lastly, other methods of prediction were compared to discover any similarities.
